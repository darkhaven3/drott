==================
drott 0.1.4 readme
==================

Very early version of a source port of Rise of the Triad (1994).
Based on rott94, and in turn the Icculus port. See README.OLD.

This port will not be intended strictly for compatibility, per se.
I will continue updating with new features as I deem necessary or
desirable, but I will generally not be touching any game behaviors.

In other words: I won't change how a Low Guard decides when to shoot
or how much damage they do, but I might change where the brackets go
in that block of code or clean up the function a little.

With that in mind, I hope to eventually create a code base that's
easy to read and modify, with a focus on extending functionality
where it makes sense to make it easy for people to make entirely
new games based on this source code if they want.

=========
NEW STUFF
=========

+ In config.rot, you can specify the window resolution with WindowWidth/WindowHeight.
+ Press F12 to toggle mouse capture within the game window.
+ Press Shift+F12 to toggle novert (like the Doom TSR).

===========
FOR MODDERS
===========

+ Up to 999 floor/ceiling flats can be used. Just include that flat by name,
  e.g. "FLRCL974" in your PWAD. Starting from the original FLRCL1 map tile value
  in your map editor of choice, add the value of your new flat and it should work.

==========
KNOWN BUGS
==========

+ Once in a blue moon, the game will just randomly close. No idea yet.
  This also happens in the Icculus port, rott94, and even rottexpr. No difference here.
+ Sky rendering is just fucked. I'm still thinking about how to address this.
+ Vertical look is not properly bounded. This has a few known effects:
  -- You can look up and launch a rocket to kill yourself.
  -- You can look up and place your head inside a wall behind you.
+ The HUD will look very wrong on game resolutions other than 800x600.
  The WindowWidth/WindowHeight settings are not related to this.
+ Saving the game is bugged. For now, take great care using this port with
  original DOS saves, if you want to preserve them. Some known effects:
  -- The savegame preview screenshot will not be written correctly.
  -- I have seen one instance of the game failing to load a save due to
     miscounting the masked walls in the level versus the savegame. Be careful!
+ The focal width is not set correctly in game resolutions other than 800x600.
  Note that, again, WindowWidth/WindowHeight does not affect this.
+ Some music tracks (particularly OWW) can get pitch-bent out of wack when
  unpausing the game. This bug existed in the other ports too.

If you encounter any other bugs, please let me know on Discord.
