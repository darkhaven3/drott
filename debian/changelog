  * Show a dialog box if files are missing. Based on patches and

      with instructions to read README.Debian.
    + Improve README.Debian with clear instructions on how to use
      game-data-packager to locate/download the game data, build the
      possible rott-*-data Debian package(s), and install it/them.

      for the supported dialog box applications.

rott (1.1.2-3) unstable; urgency=medium

    Adjust documentation and packaging accordingly.
  * Fix missing fog on level Foggy Mountain (Closes: #775530).
    Light level is calculated based on scaled texture and sprite height
    and is thus resolution-dependent, fix special-casing for fog.

  * Fix scaling of the sky texture.
